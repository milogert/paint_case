# Paint Case

Paint case for carrying miniatures and painting supplies. The case and drawers are intended to be laser cut from wood, but any material would work as long as you have a way to assemble them together.

# End Result Photos

Incoming, getting things cut soon.

# Inspiration

- [Frontier Wargaming's Paint Case 2.0](https://frontierwargaming.com/product/paint-case/)

# (Intended) Features

- Briefcase-style portability.
- Eight sections of drawers.
- All sections of drawers support lids.
  - If you were so inclined, you could make 12 sections with magnetized drawers and lids to have increased miniature storage.
- Room on the inside of the lid for a standard self-healing cutting mat.
- Each part is maintainable with minimal disassembly.
- Drawers are all the same dimensions, so you don't need to remember "this drawer for paint, this drawer for tools" etc.
- Drawers have flexible dividers so you aren't stuck just quartering each drawer.

# Tools

- [Basic Box Generator](https://www.makercase.com/#/basicbox): Making the starting boxes for everything.
- LibreCAD: Most of the other work.

# TODO

- [ ] I need to find a handle for the top somehow.
- [ ] Figure out an LED solution. The lightbar is fine, but I feel I could do better than that, perhaps using some stray LEDs on a strip of wood.
- [ ] Adhere metal to the bottom of some of the drawers.

# Warranty

This is a work in progress. If you decide to laser cut any of these cases don't come complaining to me if they don't fit together properly.
